# Running it

MicroPythonOS can run on supported microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32) and on desktop systems (Linux, Raspberry Pi, MacOS, Windows etc).

To install prebuilt software, read on!

To modify low level things under the hood, consider heading to [OS Development](../os-development/index.md).

## Running on ESP32

Just use the [WebSerial installer at install.micropythonos.com](https://install.micropythonos.com).

For advanced usage, such as installing development builds without any files, see [Installing on ESP32](../os-development/installing-on-esp32.md).
