# OS Development on Linux

Most users can just use a pre-built binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS/releases) and install it manually or using the [web installer](https://install.MicroPythonOS.com).

But if for some reason that one doesn't work, or you really want to modify things under the hood, you're in the right place here!

## Get the prerequisites

Clone the repositories:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS.git
```

That will take a while, because it recursively clones MicroPython, LVGL, ESP-IDF and all their dependencies.

While that's going on, make sure you have everything installed to compile code:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libffi-dev pkg-config cmake ninja-build gnome-desktop-testing libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libaudio-dev libjack-dev libsndio-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxfixes-dev libxi-dev libxss-dev libxkbcommon-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libdbus-1-dev libibus-1.0-dev libudev-dev fcitx-libs-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev libwayland-dev libdecor-0-dev libv4l-dev
```
