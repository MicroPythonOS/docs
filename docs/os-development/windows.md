# Building for Windows

As the main dependency ([lvgl_micropython](https://github.com/lvgl-micropython/lvgl_micropython), which bundles LVGL and MicroPython) doesn't support Windows, MicroPythonOS also doesn't support it.

But perhaps it works with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)!
It would be great if someone could give this a try and report back with the results in the chat or in a GitHub issue.

All of this is only necessary for OS development.

Even without doing a local build, you can still participate in the bulk of the fun: creating cool apps!

To do so, install a pre-built firmware on a [supported device](../getting-started/supported-hardware.md) and then over to [Creating Apps](../apps/creating-apps.md).
