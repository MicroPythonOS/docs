# Building for Windows

As the main dependency ([lvgl_micropython](https://github.com/lvgl-micropython/lvgl_micropython), which bundles LVGL and MicroPython) doesn't support Windows, MicroPythonOS also doesn't support it.

But this is only necessary for OS development.

You can still participate in the bulk of the fun: creating cool apps!

To do so, install a pre-built firmware on a [supported device](../getting-started/supported-hardware.md) and then hopping over to [Creating Apps](../apps/creating-apps.md).
