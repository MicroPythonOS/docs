# Web Port Developer Info

This section describes how MicroPythonOS runs in the browser, how to build and serve it, and everything you need to know to make changes. **The entire web port is self-contained in the main MicroPythonOS repository** — no edits to the `lvgl_micropython` submodule (or its nested `micropython`/`lvgl`) need to be committed. The submodule modifications required by the web target are stored under [`scripts/web_port/`](https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS/tree/main/scripts/web_port/) and are applied automatically at build time.

## TL;DR

```bash
# 1. One-time: install & activate the Emscripten SDK (see "Prerequisites").
#    The build auto-activates ../emsdk or ../../emsdk if emcc is not on PATH.

# 2. Build the web target.
scripts/build_mpos.sh web

# 3. Build (if needed) and serve locally at http://localhost:8080/
scripts/run_web.sh
#   scripts/run_web.sh --no-build   # serve existing web/ without rebuilding
#   PORT=9000 scripts/run_web.sh     # serve on a different port
```

Output artifacts land in `web/`: `micropython.{html,js,wasm,data}`, plus copies `index.html` and `mpos.html`.

## Prerequisites

- **Emscripten SDK** (tested with **6.0.0**). Either have `emcc` on `PATH`, or place an activated `emsdk` checkout one or two directories above this repo (`../emsdk` or `../../emsdk`). `scripts/build_mpos.sh web` sources `emsdk_env.sh` automatically when `emcc` is missing.
- Standard host toolchain to build `mpy-cross` (built with the host compiler, not emcc) and the usual MicroPython build dependencies (`python3`, `make`).
- The git submodules must be checked out (`git submodule update --init --recursive`). A **clean** submodule checkout is fine — the build re-applies the web changes every time.

## Build from a fresh clone

The entire web port lives in the main repository, so a fork is self-contained: a fresh clone plus the submodules plus an Emscripten SDK is all that is needed. The submodule C changes are re-applied automatically by the build, so **nothing needs to be committed into any submodule.**

```bash
# 1. Clone your fork with submodules.
git clone --recursive https://github.com/<you>/MicroPythonOS
cd MicroPythonOS
#   (if you forgot --recursive:)
#   git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Install + activate Emscripten 6.0.0 somewhere the build can find it
#    (emcc on PATH, or an activated emsdk at ../emsdk or ../../emsdk).

# 3. Build and serve.
scripts/build_mpos.sh web
scripts/run_web.sh
```

### Pinned submodule commits (known-good)

The two C patches apply against specific upstream revisions. If a submodule is advanced past these, `patch --forward` may reject a hunk (the build logs the failure but continues, so a broken boot can result). These are the commits this port was verified against:

| Submodule | Commit | Tag/branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lvgl_micropython` | `a491b2a` | `integration` |
| `lvgl_micropython/lib/micropython` | `78ff170` | `v1.27.0` |
| `lvgl_micropython/lib/lvgl` | `c016f72` | `v9.3.0-556` |
| `lvgl_micropython/lib/SDL` | `6ad390fc` | `release-2.26.0-4202` |
| `freezeFS` | `5f211e3` | `main` |
| `secp256k1-embedded-ecdh` | `f86eb16` | `micropython_1.25.0` |
| `micropython-camera-API` | `f88b29d` | `master` |
| `micropython-nostr` | `2375c45` | `0.9-22` |

The critical two for the web patches are `lvgl_micropython` (for `sdl_bus.h`) and `lvgl_micropython/lib/micropython` (for `gccollect.c`). A fork should pin at least those. If you bump them, regenerate the patches (see *Updating a submodule patch*) and re-verify a clean boot.

## How it works (architecture)

The web target reuses the **unix port** of MicroPython (LVGL + SDL display/input drivers, the frozen manifest, the `ext_mod` C modules) but compiles it with the Emscripten toolchain (`emcc`/`em++`/`emar`) and links Emscripten's bundled SDL2 port (`-sUSE_SDL=2`) instead of a natively built `libSDL2.a`. The result renders into an HTML `<canvas>`.

```

│ Browser tab (web/mpos.html → micropython.js + .wasm + .data) │
│                                                              │
│   <canvas>  ◀── SDL2 (Emscripten port) ◀── LVGL ◀── MPOS     │

│     └─ machine.Timer  (asyncio-backed periodic/one-shot)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Key design points:

- **`REAL_PORT = 'unix'`** — all unix patches and `machine_sdl` reuse unchanged.
- **No native threads / sockets / ffi / termios / bluetooth.** The web build sets `MICROPY_PY_THREAD/SOCKET/FFI/TERMIOS/BLUETOOTH=0`. Python modules that expect those are satisfied with small web-only shims (see below).
- **No native `machine.Timer`.** `machine_timer.c` is dropped from the web Makefile; an asyncio-backed `Timer` is injected at boot.
- **The preloaded filesystem is mounted at `/`** (root), matching the on-device layout, because `main.py` does `sys.path.insert(0, "lib")` and apps use root-relative paths like `/apps` and `/builtin`.

## Where everything lives (all in this repo)

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`scripts/build_mpos.sh`](https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS/blob/main/scripts/build_mpos.sh) | Central build orchestration. The `web` target branch does all web-specific work (patching the submodule, staging the FS, injecting shims, invoking `make.py web`, collecting artifacts). |
| [`scripts/run_web.sh`](https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS/blob/main/scripts/run_web.sh) | Build (optional) + serve `web/` with `python3 -m http.server`. |
| [`scripts/web_port/web.py`](https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS/blob/main/scripts/web_port/web.py) | The Emscripten build backend. Copied into `lvgl_micropython/builder/web.py` at build time; consumed by `make.py web`. |
| [`scripts/web_port/sdl_bus.h.patch`](https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS/blob/main/scripts/web_port/sdl_bus.h.patch) | C struct-layout fix applied to the `lcd_bus` SDL bus (see "Submodule patches"). |
| [`scripts/web_port/gccollect.c.patch`](https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS/blob/main/scripts/web_port/gccollect.c.patch) | Conservative-GC fix for wasm applied to the unix port (see "Submodule patches"). |
| [`web/shell.html`](https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS/blob/main/web/shell.html) | The HTML shell template (`--shell-file`). Build copies the produced `micropython.html` to `index.html` and `mpos.html`. |
| `web/.preload_internal_filesystem/` | Auto-generated staging copy of `internal_filesystem/` (with web shims injected). Recreated on every build; do not edit by hand. |

The web-only Python shims (`_thread.py`, `socket.py`, `_webrepl.py`, `websocket.py`, `task_handler.py`, `_web_machine_timer.py`) and the boot-time `machine.Timer` injection are written into the staged filesystem by `build_mpos.sh` (heredocs in the `web` target). They are **not** committed into `internal_filesystem/` so device builds are unaffected.

## Submodule patches (applied automatically)

The web target requires four changes inside the `lvgl_micropython` submodule. Rather than committing them to the submodule, they are stored in this repo and applied at the start of the `web` build (`patch --forward` makes re-application a no-op; the file copies are idempotent):

1. **`builder/web.py`** (full file) — the Emscripten build backend. Copied from `scripts/web_port/web.py`.
2. **`ext_mod/lcd_bus/sdl_bus/sdl_bus.h`** — adds a missing `uint32_t buffer_flags;` field to `mp_lcd_sdl_bus_obj_t` so its layout matches the generic `mp_lcd_bus_obj_t`. `lcd_panel_io_init()` casts the SDL object to the generic type and calls `panel_io_handle.init(...)`; without this field the offset of `panel_io_handle` differs on 32-bit/wasm and the indirect call reads the wrong function pointer → `function signature mismatch` trap. (On 64-bit native, struct padding hid the bug.)
3. **`lib/micropython/ports/unix/gccollect.c`** — adds an `__EMSCRIPTEN__` branch to `gc_collect()` that uses `emscripten_scan_stack()` + `emscripten_scan_registers()` instead of the setjmp-based `gc_helper_collect_regs_and_stack()`. On wasm, live object pointers live in wasm locals/registers (not linear memory) and are invisible to a memory scan, so the stock collector freed in-use objects → `memory access out of bounds`. This matches the upstream MicroPython `ports/webassembly` approach and **requires ASYNCIFY** (so registers can be spilled), enabled via `-sASYNCIFY=1` in `web.py`.
4. **`ext_mod/_webnet/`** (new files, not a patch) — the browser `fetch()` bridge for HTTP networking. `webnet.c` + `micropython.mk` are copied from `scripts/web_port/ext_mod/_webnet/`; the `.mk` only compiles it when `MPOS_WEB=1`. See *Networking* below.

### Updating a submodule patch

If you need to change one of the patched submodule files:

```bash
# Edit the file directly in the submodule, then regenerate the patch:
cd lvgl_micropython
git diff -- ext_mod/lcd_bus/sdl_bus/sdl_bus.h \
    > ../scripts/web_port/sdl_bus.h.patch

cd lib/micropython
git diff -- ports/unix/gccollect.c \
    > ../../../scripts/web_port/gccollect.c.patch

# For web.py, just copy it back:
cp lvgl_micropython/builder/web.py scripts/web_port/web.py
```

To verify reproducibility, revert the submodule files and rebuild — the build should re-apply everything:

```bash
( cd lvgl_micropython \
    && git checkout -- ext_mod/lcd_bus/sdl_bus/sdl_bus.h \
    && rm -f builder/web.py ext_mod/lcd_bus/sdl_bus/sdl_bus.h.rej \
    && rm -rf ext_mod/_webnet )
( cd lvgl_micropython/lib/micropython && git checkout -- ports/unix/gccollect.c )
scripts/build_mpos.sh web
```

The two C patches were verified to apply cleanly (`patch --forward`, exit 0, no `.rej`) against the pinned commits listed in *Build from a fresh clone*.

## Build flags (in `scripts/web_port/web.py`)

The Emscripten link flags (`web_ldflags`) are the main tuning surface:

| Flag | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `-sUSE_SDL=2` | Use Emscripten's bundled SDL2 port. |
| `-sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1`, `-sINITIAL_MEMORY=...`, `-sMAXIMUM_MEMORY=...` | Heap sizing. |
| `-sSTACK_SIZE=8388608` | Larger stack for deep LVGL/MPOS call chains. |
| `-sASYNCIFY=1 -sASYNCIFY_STACK_SIZE=32768` | **Required** for `emscripten_scan_registers()` in the GC fix. |
| `-sFORCE_FILESYSTEM=1 -sEXIT_RUNTIME=0` | Keep the runtime + virtual FS alive. |
| `-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition` | MicroPython's libc `printf` vs Emscripten libc `printf` duplicate. |
| `-sASSERTIONS=2 --profiling-funcs` | **Debug only.** Symbolized stacks. Remove for an optimized production build. |

Module disabling and SDL include/link selection happen via `MPOS_WEB=1` and the `MICROPY_PY_*=0` make variables, also set in `web.py`.

## Web-only Python shims (staged into `lib/`)

Written by `build_mpos.sh` into `web/.preload_internal_filesystem/lib/` so they shadow frozen/native modules at runtime without affecting device builds:

| Shim | Replaces | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_thread.py` | native `_thread` | Cooperative: runs thread bodies as asyncio tasks; locks are no-ops; `get_ident()==1`. |
| `socket.py` | native `socket` | Stub; raises `OSError` on use (no browser raw sockets). |
| `_webrepl.py` / `websocket.py` | native modules | Stubs; raise `OSError` on use. |
| `task_handler.py` | frozen `task_handler` | Drives `lv.task_handler()` + `lv.tick_inc()` from an asyncio task instead of `machine.Timer`. Same public API (`TaskHandler`, `TASK_HANDLER_STARTED/FINISHED`, `add_event_cb`, `disable/enable`, `deinit`). |
| `_web_machine_timer.py` | `machine.Timer` | asyncio-backed periodic/one-shot timer. |

### `machine.Timer` injection

The native `machine` module dict is read-only, so `machine.Timer = ...` fails. Instead, `build_mpos.sh` patches the **staged** copy of `main.py` (never the device source) right after `sys.path.insert(0, "lib")` to replace `sys.modules["machine"]` with a thin wrapper exposing `Timer` and delegating all other attributes to the native module.

## Networking (HTTP via browser `fetch()`)

The browser has no raw TCP/UDP sockets, so `socket` is stubbed and `MICROPY_PY_SOCKET=0`. HTTP instead goes through the browser's `fetch()` API via a small native module plus an `aiohttp` shim:

| Piece | Location | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_webnet` native module | `scripts/web_port/ext_mod/_webnet/webnet.c` (+ `micropython.mk`) | C/`EM_JS` bridge to the browser `fetch()` and `WebSocket` APIs. Non-blocking, poll-based so the asyncio/UI loop keeps running. Built only for web (`MPOS_WEB=1`); copied into `lvgl_micropython/ext_mod/_webnet/` by `build_mpos.sh`. |
| `aiohttp` shim | staged `lib/aiohttp/__init__.py` (heredoc in `build_mpos.sh`) | Re-implements `ClientSession.get/post/put/...` on top of `_webnet`'s fetch bridge, and `ClientSession.ws_connect()` on top of `_webnet`'s WebSocket bridge, polling with `await asyncio.sleep_ms(...)`. Imports `WSMsgType` from the device `aiohttp_ws.py`. |

`_webnet` HTTP API: `fetch_start(method, url, headers_json, body)` returns an int handle; then `poll(h)` (0 pending / 1 done / -1 error), `status(h)`, `headers(h)`, `body(h)`, `error(h)`, and `free(h)`.

`_webnet` WebSocket API: `ws_open(url, protocols_json)` returns a handle; `ws_state(h)` (0 connecting / 1 open / 2 closing / 3 closed), `ws_peek_type(h)` (0 none / 1 text / 2 binary), `ws_peek_len(h)`, `ws_read(h)` (pops the front message as bytes), `ws_send_text(h, str)`, `ws_send_bytes(h, bytes)`, `ws_close(h)`, `ws_error(h)`, and `ws_free(h)`.

**Limitations:**

- **CORS applies.** Cross-origin requests fail unless the server sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. The default app-store/OTA hosts do not, so those downloads fail in the browser with `fetch failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch` — this is a server-side policy, not a port bug. Same-origin or CORS-enabled endpoints work.
- **WebSockets work**, via the browser `WebSocket` API (`ClientSession.ws_connect`). Unlike `fetch()`, cross-origin WebSockets are not blocked by CORS (the server decides via the `Origin` header), so e.g. Nostr relays connect. Limitation: the browser WebSocket API cannot set custom request headers, so any `headers` passed to `ws_connect`/`ClientSession` are ignored for the WS handshake.

## Persistence (writable FS via IndexedDB / IDBFS)

The bulk of the filesystem (`/lib`, `/builtin`, `main.py`) is baked read-only into `micropython.data` at link time. Two paths are instead mounted from the browser's IndexedDB so writes survive a page reload:

| Path | Backing | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/data` | IDBFS (IndexedDB) | App preferences / config (`SharedPreferences` writes `data/<app>/config.json`). |
| `/apps` | IDBFS (IndexedDB) | User-installed apps (`AppManager` installs to `apps/<fullname>`) and a one-time copy of the bundled demo apps. |

How it is wired up:

- **Link flag:** `-lidbfs.js` is added to `web_ldflags` in `scripts/web_port/web.py` so the IDBFS backend is available.
- **Mount + load (boot):** `web/shell.html`'s `Module.preRun` mounts IDBFS at `/data` and `/apps`, then gates the runtime start on `FS.syncfs(true, …)` (wrapped in `addRunDependency`/`removeRunDependency`) so Python only starts once the persisted contents are loaded from IndexedDB.
- **Why those two paths are excluded from the preload:** `FS.syncfs(true)` reconciles the in-memory FS to match the IndexedDB store, so a mount point must not also be a `--preload-file` target — otherwise the first boot (empty store) would wipe the preloaded files. `build_mpos.sh` therefore stages the tree **without** `apps/` and `data/`: the bundled demo apps are packaged separately at `/.bundled_apps` (`--preload-file …@/.bundled_apps`) and `data/` is dropped (IDBFS recreates it empty).
- **Seeding bundled apps:** on first run `seedBundledApps()` copies `/.bundled_apps` into `/apps` once and writes a `/apps/.seeded` marker, so the bundled apps appear via the normal `AppManager` scan. The marker means a user uninstalling a bundled app makes the removal stick across reloads instead of being re-seeded every boot.
- **Flushing writes:** `startPersistFlush()` periodically calls `FS.syncfs(false, …)` (every few seconds, plus on `pagehide` and when the tab is hidden) to push writes back to IndexedDB.

Notes / limitations:

- Persistence is per-origin and subject to the browser's IndexedDB storage quota and eviction policy (clearing site data wipes it).
- No device-side code changed: `AppManager` install/uninstall and `SharedPreferences` use their normal relative paths (`apps/…`, `data/…`), which resolve to the IDBFS mounts because the working directory is `/`.

## Making changes — common scenarios

- **Change MPOS Python code / apps:** edit under `internal_filesystem/` as usual, then rebuild (`scripts/build_mpos.sh web`). The staged FS is rebuilt every time, so changes are picked up. (Most of the FS is baked into `micropython.data` at link time; a rebuild is required — there is no live file mount. `/data` and `/apps` are the exception: they persist in IndexedDB across reloads — see "Persistence".)
- **Change the HTML/JS shell:** edit `web/shell.html`, rebuild. `index.html` and `mpos.html` are regenerated from it.
- **Change build/link flags:** edit `scripts/web_port/web.py`, rebuild.
- **Change a patched submodule C file:** see "Updating a submodule patch".
- **Add another web-only shim:** add a heredoc in the `web` branch of `scripts/build_mpos.sh` next to the existing shims.

## Testing in a browser

Serve with `scripts/run_web.sh` and open the page. When iterating, note that `micropython.data` (the preloaded FS) is cached **separately** from the wasm, so hard-reload / disable cache (or append a cache-busting query like `?v=2`) when testing filesystem changes.

A clean boot prints the banner, the `RAM: ... free` line, then `Passing execution over to mpos.main`, and renders the launcher. The following console messages are **expected and non-fatal** in the browser:

- `no ADC` / `module 'machine' has no attribute 'ADC'` (no battery ADC)
- `mpos.imu.drivers.iio: Error listing dir` (no IMU)
- `download error` / `fetch failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch` for the default app-store/OTA hosts (CORS-blocked cross-origin requests — see *Networking*).
- `no module named 'esp32'`
- `aiorepl ... EIO` (browser stdin cannot be read)

A **fatal** problem would instead show `memory access out of bounds`, `function signature mismatch`, or `MicroPythonOS exiting`.

## Production build checklist

- Remove the debug flags `-sASSERTIONS=2 --profiling-funcs` from `web_ldflags` in `scripts/web_port/web.py`.
- Rebuild and serve the contents of `web/` from any static host.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

[`scripts/deploy_web_pages.sh`](https://github.com/MicroPythonOS/MicroPythonOS/blob/main/scripts/deploy_web_pages.sh) builds the web export and force-pushes the contents of `web/` as a single commit to a `gh-pages` branch. It is a plain command (no GitHub Action / CI), so you run it whenever you want to update the live site.

```bash
scripts/deploy_web_pages.sh                 # build, then deploy to remote `fork`
scripts/deploy_web_pages.sh --no-build      # deploy the existing web/ as-is
REMOTE=origin scripts/deploy_web_pages.sh   # deploy to a different remote
BRANCH=gh-pages scripts/deploy_web_pages.sh # use a different branch
```

One-time setup on GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: "Deploy from a branch", Branch: `gh-pages` / `(root)`**. The site is then served at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`.

The script adds a `.nojekyll` file so Pages serves the underscore-prefixed `.preload_internal_filesystem/` directory verbatim (Jekyll would otherwise skip it). The `gh-pages` branch holds only generated artifacts and is overwritten on every deploy.
